## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

In this project I have discovered the details HTML element. I really like how it behaves and is structured.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/frontend-quiz-app-BE7xkzXQnU) - The design on the bottom of the page introduced me to details element.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand details element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
